<h1 id="about-us">About Us</h1>

<p>We are a team of researchers and engineers working to create state-of-the-art
programming-by-example and other technologies for data wrangling and other application domains of program synthesis.
This is a revolutionary charter since 99% of computer users lack programming skills, and data
scientists spend 80% of their time wrangling with data. The team includes:</p>

        <p>Sumit has been an MSR veteran
for the past 10 years, working on program synthesis (developing technologies for
<em>programming-by-examples</em> and <em>programming-by-natural-language</em>) and computer-aided education
(developing technologies for automated grading and automated problem generation in
various subject domains like programming, algebra, geometry, and language learning). His
programming-by-example work has shipped in Excel 2013, and more recently in Azure OMS and
Powershell 2015, while his automated grading work has been deployed at 10+ Universities
for grading of programming and automata construction exercises. He is an
inter-disciplinary prolific researcher who has co-authored 100+ research articles, most
of which have been published in top-tier conferences across various areas including
Programming Languages, Software Engineering, AI, ML, HCI, and Databases. He has been
regularly invited to give keynotes and talks at conferences, workshops, and colloquiums.
He is a recipient of the prestigious <em>Robin Milner Young Researcher Award</em> for the year
2014 for outstanding contributions (made in the first twenty years of one&rsquo;s research career)
to the field of programming languages. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from
UC-Berkeley in 2005, and was awarded the <em>ACM SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation
Award</em>. He obtained his Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur
(India) in 2000, and was awarded the President&rsquo;s Gold Medal for best academic performance.</p>

Microsoft. He obtained his PhD at the University of California, Davis in 2015, and his BEng at
Vietnam National University in 2006. His research focuses on automatic program generation to
help improve the quality of critical software and make programming more accessible to end
users. His work has led to important shipped features in commercial products (such as Windows)
and hundreds of bug reports/fixes in widely used, critical open-source software (such as GCC and LLVM).</p>

in research and implementation of solutions that automate repetitive programming tasks for
engineers, consumers, and educators. Alex initiated the program synthesis framework that forms
the core of Microsoft PROSE SDK, and continues to lead its development.
Before joining the team, he worked on automatic problem
generation for intelligent tutoring systems in <a href="http://centerforgamescience.org/">Center for Game Science</a>, programming languages for data wrangling, and linguistic algorithms for <a href="https://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>.</p>

        <p>Mohammad&rsquo;s background and interests
are in formal methods for reasoning about computer programs. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from Imperial College London and a Masters in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge. He works on the development of
techniques and tools for program synthesis through natural
interaction paradigms such as programming by examples, natural language, or a combination
of such approaches. In particular, he is interested in the applications of these techniques
for data wrangling tasks such as extraction, formatting, cleaning, or transformations in
various data formats including spreadsheets, text documents, and richly formatted documents.
In the PROSE Team his current focus is on developing examples-based and fully automated
synthesis technologies for information extraction from web pages.</p>
