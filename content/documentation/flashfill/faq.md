### What is FlashFill?

FlashFill is a system for performing string transformation operations.
When you have a number of similar strings which you need to rewrite or extract
data from, FlashFill can perform the operation given the correct output on
just a few (often only one) examples.


### Is this the same as the FlashFill feature in Excel?

No. Both are based on the same research, but the implementations are
independent and have differing feature sets. Our goal is to have this
implementation exceed the capabilities of the Excel implementation,
but that is not the case at the moment.
