### What is `Transformation.Text`?

`Transformation.Text` is a system for performing string transformation
operations.
When you have a number of similar strings which you need to rewrite or extract
data from, `Transformation.Text` can perform the operation given the correct
output on
just a few (often only one) examples.


### Is this the same as the FlashFill feature in Excel?

No. Both are based on the same research, but the implementations are
independent and have differing feature sets. While the PROSE implementation
exceeds the capabilities of the Excel implementation in most respects,
the Excel implementation may still perform better in some scenarios.
