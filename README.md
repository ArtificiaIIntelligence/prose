# Microsoft Program Synthesis using Examples SDK

The Program Synthesis using Examples (PROSE) SDK includes a set of technologies for the automatic generation of programs from input-output examples. This repo includes samples and sample data for the Microsoft PROSE SDK.

The samples are split into two categories:

* Program synthesis samples in [ProseSamples.sln](ProseSamples.sln)
* Data wrangling samples in [WranglingSamples.sln](WranglingSamples.sln)
