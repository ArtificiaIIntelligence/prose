# PROSE Website

This repository contains documents and templates used to build and deploy the PROSE website (http://microsoft.github.io/prose). The website is hosted using GitHub pages. Therefore, the deployment process involves pushing to a branch called gh-pages on the repository associated with our public code samples.

Steps to run while locally iterating on a website change:

 * Make your change (likely to a markdown file in /content/documentation)
 * Build Shim.sln in Visual Studio (only required if you made any TypeScript changes, commit compile JS if you do)
 * `hugo server --watch -b "http://localhost:1313/"` (overriding the `baseURL` like this required for local viewing)
 * Open and monitor http://localhost:1313/ in your browser (will auto-refresh for most changes)
 
Please DO commit the code generated by hugo in /public. This directory is read by jekyll and used to serve the actual webpage.
