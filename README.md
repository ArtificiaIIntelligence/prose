# Microsoft Program Synthesis using Examples SDK

The Program Synthesis using Examples (PROSE) SDK includes a set of technologies for the automatic generation of programs from input-output examples. This repo includes samples and sample data for the Microsoft PROSE SDK.

The samples are split into two categories:

* Program synthesis samples in [ProseSample.sln](ProgramSynthesis/ProseSample.sln)
* Data wrangling samples in [Samples.sln](Samples.sln)
